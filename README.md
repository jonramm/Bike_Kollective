**Installation**

Testing on an emulator (recommended):

For iOS:

  2. You can run the build using Xcode Simulator. Open a simulator via Xcode > Open Developer Tools > Simulator. 
  3. Select an iPhone model. 
  4. Unzip the downloaded .gzip file. 
  5. Drag the unzipped client app file into the simulator. 
  6. Click the client app from within the simulator.

For Android:
  1. Download the Android apk file. 
  2. You can install the app directly on your phone by opening the .apk on your phone, which will ask to install an unknown app. Please enable installing unknown apps in your      phoneâ€™s settings. 
  3. Alternatively, you can run an emulator on your laptop, by opening Android Studio > File > Profile or Debug APK > Select the .apk file. 
  4. Set up a AVD to run the emulator or you can plug in an Android device to your laptop via USB (first enable developer options on your phone) and run the app on a physical      device. 

Note: 
If you receive this error when testing the .apk file: 
The APK failed to install.
Error: INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE: Package com.bikekollective.bikekollective signatures do not match previously installed version; ignoring!

Make sure to delete any old versions of the app from the emulator first before installing the latest apk.
