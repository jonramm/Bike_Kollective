# Bike_Kollective

Bike Kollective is a mobile bike sharing app that allows users
to find and check out bikes, or add their own bike to the network.

**Setting up a development environment:**

1. Clone git repository to your local computer.

2. `cd` to the root of the project folder.

3. Run `npm install` in both the root directory and the 'client' folder.

4. Start the nodemon development backend server with `npm start` in the root directory.

5. `cd` to the client folder and run `npx expo start`. This will start the Metro bundler for the mobile app.

6. Follow instructions for testing the app on Android and iOS devices.
